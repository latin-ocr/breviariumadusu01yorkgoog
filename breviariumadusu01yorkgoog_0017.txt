still the guardians os the trust. After Fothergill the next
known possessor os the book was one Edw. Jacob,¹ from
whom it passed in the year 1789 to the great collector
Richard Gough. and by him was left with the rest os his
books to the Bodleian in 1809.

1t remains that 1 should express my grateful thanks to
those to whom they are due. First to the gentlemen who
have so sreely put the use os their volumes at my disposal,
Mr. Blew os Warwick Street, Pall Mall, Mr. Sherbrooke os
Oxton, Southwell, Mr. Davies Cooke of Owston. Doncaster,
Dr. Gott, Vicar os Leeds, and the authorities os York
Cathedrax. Tu the first-named os these, the Reverend
william J. Blew, my special thanks are offered, sor his
unwean'ed sriendliness and ready help. To Mr. Bradshaw
also. and to the Reverend Canon Raine, 1 am under great
obligations: and from the Reverend joseph Fowler οἱ Dur-
harn, and {rom the Editors os the new Sarum Breviary (the
Reverend Francis Proeter and the Reverend Christopher
Wordswosth), 1 have received kind assistance and an inspee-
tion os valuable materials.

The following is a table os all the editions known and
copies extant os the York Breviary, with the place and date
os printing. and summary os contents.¹ The book is assumed
to be made up us the four component parts described in the
Introduction to Messrs. Procter and Wordsworth¹s Sarum
