Lepus to the elergy of England, exactly similar to that
in the Sarum Breviary of 1524, now in the Libmry os
. Oscott College. (3) Psalter and Commune exactly the
same as that in the Pars Hyemzlis» (4) Sanctorale,
from tbe Annunciation to S. Saturninus Signamres
AA to ΖΖ, then the abbreviations sor ‘et' and ¹con,’
211 in eights, and the abbreviation sor 'us’ in sevens.
Probably there is one folio wanting at tbe end which
would have contained the imprint This Psalter, Com-
mune and Sanctorale have, as the Pars Hyemalis,
double columns with 33 lines in each column. These
two volun-res ase bound by Hayday, and lettered un.
sortunately Breviarium Ehomoeuse. In εἰη they are
five inches and three—eights by three and a halfe and in
the P. Esn'valis in the Temporale, between the Saturday
aster Pentecost and Tn'nity Sunday, is inserted an
enom-rous Pye of 94 ρεξτε.
This very valuahle copy os the Breviaty did not come into
my hands till the greater part of this volume was
printed. The collation os it begins at col. 677.
