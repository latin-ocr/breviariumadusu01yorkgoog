This is a copy os the whole Breviary in one volume, but
with many an ‘hiatus valde deflendus! It has neither title
nor general impu-int: and the Kalendar is gone. The first
solio (unpagcd) is a 2 : solio τ is gone, whether it were blank
or had the title. (1) Temporale. The first series os signatures
runs from a to τ, all in eiglm: from Advent to Easter Eve.
·The second serie· goes from aato mm, all in eights, [τοττι Easter
Eve to the Commemorations. But astermm 8 b comes an hiatus
probably os 8 solies τ and there also should have been placed
the Kalendar. (2) Psalter and Commune. Third sen'es os sig-
natures from A i to M 8 b from Sunday Mattius to Commune
unius virginis. ‘The commune wants a part us the service
'unius virginis, all os plurimarum virginum and unius ma-
¹tr0nae: and another os unius virginis. lt is deficient in the
‘Commemoratio B. Mai-ie Virginis, and it wants the Corn-
* memorations os S. William, os SS. Peter and Paul, and
“ All Saints ς as separate services coming with special ruhi-ic
¹ aster the Commemoratio B. Mane V. and before S. Andrew⁴
⁴ It wants likewise a series os Benedictions! (MS. note by
Rev. w.J. Blew.) (3) Sam-,torale begins on ccj. (aa and bb want-
ing), and runs on to hh 6 b (hh is signed hhij.) Here occurs
the only colophon in the volume. 11 Finis prime partis hujus
breviarii scilicet temporis hyemalis de sanctis. There then
occurs a terrible lacuna from anj to oo 8 (112 solios): pp and
qq ane there in eigins and vv xx and yy: rrj to tt 8 are
wanting. and ol* z solius ι, 2, 7 and 8 are wanting, and all that
would complete the services of S. Katherine S. Linus and
S. Saturninus. The book is ςξ inches by 33, and has 2
columns in a page and 32 lines to each column. 1t is bound in
dark green morocco with a silver cross iet in on either board-
It is lettered ¹ Breviarium Ebcuracerxse⁴ Pars Hyemalis.’ We
have ventured to assign it to the date os 1507, classing it
with the French edition printed about then sor G. Wanssort
os York.
